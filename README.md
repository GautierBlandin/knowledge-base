# Knowledge Base
I created this as a summary of all the self-learning I'm doing in order to provide recruiters or other CS students with an view of my areas of competence and also as a To-Do list that gives me an overview of the things I want to learn.

For every item in the list, there are links for the ressources I used to learn it, the notes and flashcard that I wrote to remember it and, if appicable, links to my own implementations or project making use of the concept. ~items~ styled with strikethrough are items that I do not know yet but plan to learn.
